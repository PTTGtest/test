This is a TypeScript project with the following file structure:

```
my-typescript-project

├── dist

```

The `src` folder contains the source code for the project, including an `index.ts` file and a `utils` folder with `math.ts` and `strings.ts` files.

The `dist` folder will contain the compiled JavaScript code, with a `bundle.js` file.

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration.

The `package.json` file contains the project's dependencies and scripts.

To get started with this project, run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript. You can then run the project with `node dist/bundle.js`.
